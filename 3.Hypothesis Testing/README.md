# Hypothesis Testing :
---> Hypothesis testing is a part of statistics in which we make assumptions about the population parameter. So, hypothesis testing mentions a proper procedure by analysing a random sample of the population to accept or reject the assumption. Hypothesis testing is the way of trying to make sense of assumptions by looking at the sample data.
# Type of Hypothesis :
---> The best way to determine whether a statistical hypothesis is true would be to examine the entire population. Since that is often impractical, researchers typically examine a random sample from the population. If sample data are not consistent with the statistical hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected. There are two types of statistical hypotheses.
- Null Hypothesis :
The null hypothesis, denoted by Ho, is usually the hypothesis that sample observations result purely from chance.

- Alternative Hypothesis :
The alternative hypothesis, denoted by H1 or Ha, is the hypothesis that sample observations are influenced by some non-random cause.
