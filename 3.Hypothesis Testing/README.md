# Assignment03-Hypothesis-Testing
ExcelR Data Science Assignment No 3
# Hypothesis Testing :
---> Hypothesis testing is a part of statistics in which we make assumptions about the population parameter. So, hypothesis testing mentions a proper procedure by analysing a random sample of the population to accept or reject the assumption. Hypothesis testing is the way of trying to make sense of assumptions by looking at the sample data.
# Type of Hypothesis :
---> The best way to determine whether a statistical hypothesis is true would be to examine the entire population. Since that is often impractical, researchers typically examine a random sample from the population. If sample data are not consistent with the statistical hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected. There are two types of statistical hypotheses.
- Null Hypothesis :
The null hypothesis, denoted by Ho, is usually the hypothesis that sample observations result purely from chance.

- Alternative Hypothesis :
The alternative hypothesis, denoted by H1 or Ha, is the hypothesis that sample observations are influenced by some non-random cause.

## This assignment will study following Questions:
**Question 1**:<br>
A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.<br>

**Question 2**<br>
A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch.Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.<br>

**Question 3**<br>
Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.<br>

**Question 4**<br>
TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain % of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing. The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences<br>
